# Rails from the Bottom Up

This is a tutorial to Rails that goes through each level of the stack to demonstrate how they operate.  To start, get a Ruby environment [set up](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=3.2#sec:rubygems), and run the following in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/afeld/rails-bottom-up.git
$ cd rails-bottom-up
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```
